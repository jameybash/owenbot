Owenbot is just my silly project to practice my integrations and dunk on my friends. I appreciate your interest, but please don't bother contributing to this silliness, it would be a waste of time, lol.

However, Owenbot was originally forked from [slack-mathbot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-mathbot), so please take your excitement and enthusiasm for contributing over to the original repo!

You can skip straight to their contributing guide [here](https://github.com/dblock/slack-mathbot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
